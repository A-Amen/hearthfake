Inspired by [Rarran's Do You Know Hearthstone?](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbWetr69v7tlIa6x6n_k7OCwdmZ3YPzDj) series, this game challenges you to spot errors on Hearthstone cards.

## How to Play:

Your goal is to determine if a card has any mistakes. If it does, identify whatâ€™s wrong!

## Possible Errors:
- Cost (Mana cost)
- Health
- Attack (Weapon and Minion)
- Gem (Rarity) Except Heroes
- Text
- Race (Minion type)
- Spell School
- Durability (Weapon and Location)
## Things That Are Always Correct:
- Card Class (Ex. Whether it is a Paladin Card or a Warrior Card)
- Text Formatting (Punctuation and spacing)
- Card Image
- Card Name
- Card Emblem (Ex. Whether card was released in TGT or Naxx)

Good luck, and may your knowledge of Hearthstone be strong!
